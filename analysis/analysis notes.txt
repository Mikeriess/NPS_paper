Study 2:
==============

We will utilize discrete event simulations to compare the performance of different queue disciplines, specifically we will compare the NPS-based prioritization approach with FCFS, ... . 

We will compare them on the following KPIS: 
- tNPS gain, 
- average throughput time
- average waiting time in queue
- cases processed

>>>> KPIs must be measured after convergence (day #)
	- Measure only cases arriving after/on that day

We will also assess at which period these KPIs stabilize.
- define a convergence criteria (e.g. sum of deltas over n timeperiods is less than z%) 

Another aspect: optimization
- Gridsearch of number of agents
- objective: number of servers needed to achieve stable performance
- Factors: queue-discipline, SLA/non-SLA
- cost function:
	- convergence criteria + min(%idle time)

TODO:
=============

CONVERGENCE:
1) Burn-in iterations: Perform gridsearch of factors, using n_cases_waiting_in_queue as convergence criteria
- max iterations (365 days)

RELATIVE PERFORMANCE:
2) Perform main experiments using warmup period found in (1)
- produce regression tables
- produce plots
*** important *** main experiment has to start at same date 01/07/2018, so simulation period must start at (burn-in iterations minus start date)
