# Notes

**Joachim can get TT up to ̃ R2 of 20%**

- Excluding outliers TT

- Assuming certain things are known

- Best model; Linear

- Best correlation with NPS post-modelling weibull link function (terms; identified through stepwise forward)



## Alternative approach





# Going forward

- Continue with models fitted on the "actual" data?

- Change the simulation parameters?

- Fit a model in each experiment?





**Experiment start:**

- Let 100 days pass

- Fit weibull model on first 100 days:  TT  ̃  casetopic + weekday + month

# Report

y = closed_avg_simulated_NPS

x= number of agents (1, 3, 5), priority_scheme (FCFS, NPS)

F_tNPS_wtime_effect_bis (0, 100, 500, 1000)



.....



# New approach to study 3:

Re-parameterize the simulation model with other values than from the calibration data
