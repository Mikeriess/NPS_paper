Alternatives:
	1.	Increase the effect factor of the betas quite a bit more
        - we did this with no effect
	2.	Introduce a topic prediction model, which throughput time prediction depends on
	⁃	Or treat the topic as known at the time
	3.	_

Conclusion;
Seems as if we need to increase prediction performance of TT and NPS

Decision:
- revise prediction models => use the same dataset, and
	- Mike finds the best dataset
