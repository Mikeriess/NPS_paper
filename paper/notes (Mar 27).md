# Restructure the paper

- Expand the intro (hypothesis developments in the intro)
- Tabular presentations of data etc.
- Review on (mini meta analysis; quantiles) on customer satisfaction and waiting time
    - Restrict ourselves to empirical studies.
    - The efffect on waiting time on customer satisfaction
- Expand with a scenario analysis

## Study 3: Scenario analysis
Here we change our simulation model
- Degree to which NPS depends on waiting time
- Generate scenarios
    - Identify at which levels we start to see an effect if satisfaction depended more on waiting time
    - Grid search approach
